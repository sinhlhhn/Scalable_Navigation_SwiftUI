This is my implementation using NavigationStack and navigationDestination modifier to handle some scenarios:
- Push, push, push and pop to root
- Push, present, push, push and pop to root
- Push, present, push, push and dismiss
Feel free to request more scenarios if you want

- Pros:
Decouple View and Navigation
Easy to create a dynamic flow

- Cons:
It does not have functionality to pop to specific view
Feel free to discuss deeply about Navigation

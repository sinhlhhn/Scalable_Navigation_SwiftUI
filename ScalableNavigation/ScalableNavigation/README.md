This is my implementation using NavigationStack and navigationDestination modifier to handle some scenarios:
- Push, push, push and pop to root
- Push, present, push, push and pop to root
- Push, present, push, push and dismiss
Feel free to request more scenario if you want

Pros:
- Decouple View and Navigation
- Easy to create a dynamic flow

Cons:
- Does not have functionality to pop to specific view

Feel free to discuss deeply about Navigation
